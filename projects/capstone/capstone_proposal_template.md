## Proposal
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_


### Domain Background

Music discovery is a challenge for almost everybody who loves music because of the sheer amount on music that is produced every day. Because there is so much music available, it's safe to assume that there's enough music available to suit everybody's tastes if only music could be categorized efficiently. There are a number of companies working on this but there is still a lot to be done.

Due to the very subjective nature of taste, it's hard to define metrics that will sufficiently capture a person's taste in music. Genre is a simple metric to define the kind of music which brings us closer to defining the kind of music in a song while cutting across other factors that influence choice of music like artist, country etc. 

In this project, I aim to develop an algorithm to determine genre of a given piece of music. Additionally, I'd like to identify other attributes that can be used to group similar music together.

### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is making music discovery simpler by analyzing existing labelled data as well as raw music files to identify music that sounds and feels similar. This can be used to build a system which can recommend new music given somebody's listening history and other feedback like likes/dislikes (direct feedback) or playback behavior (playing on repeat

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
